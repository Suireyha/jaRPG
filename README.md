Major Assignment for Comp1010, MQ University

##Team:
###Marvin Kelly, Caleb Chew, RJ, Kong

##Project Outline:

As for writing this, the goal for this project is to develop a text-based RPG where a Character can create a small party of Heros, each of which belongs to it's own class (Barbarian, Wizard, etc), it's own race (Elf, Dwarf, etc), has certain equiptment (Iron sword, wooden shield, etc) to battle a computer generated or pre-defined party (to be determined) in order to win.

Actions- especially combat actions- will be determined as succesfull or unsiccesfull by a dice roll plus some modifier. Each action will have its own threshold that must be met in order for the action to be successful. For example, to attack a goblin with a sword, a dice roll of 10 might be required and thus if the user rolls 8 and has an attack modifier (likely strength in this case) of +3, they pass the check and attack the goblin since their total was 11, as 11 > 10.

For now, the player wins if their party can defeat the opponent party so as to not broaden the scope of this project too much initially.

Players will interface with the game via the terminal, giving text commands for their actions.

##Project 'Problem'

This application is *being* designed to create an enjoyable text-based RPG that includes the fundemental features of an RPG, which we consider:
- Character System (Race, class, attributes, etc)
- Combat System with table top esque calculations
- An Objective
- A way to lose

##How to run the program

To be determined :)
