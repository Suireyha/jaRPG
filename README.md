# jaRPG
Major Assignment for Comp1010, MQ University

## Team:
**Marvin Kelly, Caleb Chew, RJ, Kong**

## Project Outline:

jaRPG is a terminal based RPG where the user can create their own party of heroes, each with their own class, weapons, armour, race etc. The user's party will face up against enemy parties in a FIGHT TO THE DEATH!!!! Upgrade your weapons and kill as many as you can.

Combat actions are determined as succesfull or unsiccesfull by a dice roll plus some modifier. Each action will have its own threshold that must be met in order for the action to be successful. For example, to attack a goblin with a sword, a dice roll of 10 might be required and thus if the user rolls 8 and has an attack modifier (likely strength in this case) of +3, they pass the check and attack the goblin since their total was 11, as 11 > 10.

For now, the player wins if their party can defeat the opponent party so as to not broaden the scope of this project too much initially.

Players interface with the game via the terminal, giving text commands for their actions.

## Project 'Problem'

This application is *being* designed to create an enjoyable text-based RPG that includes the fundemental features of an RPG, which we consider:
* Character System (Race, class, attributes, etc)
* Item System (Weapons, armour, etc)
* Combat System with table top esque calculations
* An Objective
* A way to lose

## How to run the program
After executing, the user should be greeted with a list of avaliable commands. This list can be recalled by typing HELP



## Project Roadmap (IMPORTANT!!)

### Bug Fixes....
We need to fix a lot.

### Levels + Random Enemy Generation
We can add multiple levels if we want to. Random enemy generation would be good too so that the enemies don't get stale

### Additional Content
Add additional races, classes, items, levels, etc.

### Interface (UNLIKELY)
Graduate from the text based interface

## Contribution Estimates
Marvin Kelly -> 40%
Caleb Chew   -> 20%
RJ           -> 20%
Kong         -> 20%
